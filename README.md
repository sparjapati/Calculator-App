A simple calculator is a basic electronic device that is designed to perform simple arithmetic calculations. It typically consists of a keypad with numeric keys and various function keys for mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Additionally, it may have keys for functions such as square root, percentage, and exponentiation.

The device has a small screen or display that displays the results of the calculations. Simple calculators are widely available in various designs and models, and they are generally affordable and easy to use. They are portable and often battery-powered, making them convenient for use on-the-go.

Simple calculators are commonly used for everyday calculations in homes, offices, and schools. For example, they may be used for balancing a checkbook, calculating the tip at a restaurant, or performing simple math problems in a math class. They are also used in various industries for basic calculations, such as in finance and accounting.

Despite their basic functions, some simple calculators can also perform more advanced operations, such as trigonometric functions, logarithmic functions, and statistical functions. However, these features are typically found on more advanced models.

Overall, simple calculators are essential tools for performing basic arithmetic calculations, and they are widely used in various settings.
